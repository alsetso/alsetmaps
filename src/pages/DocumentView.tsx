Whether you're collecting diagnostic reports, legal documents, signed forms, spreadsheet uploads, CRM webhooks, or API responses, this module transforms raw inputs into structured JSON. Every piece of data is automatically normalized, tagged, and made ready for downstream automation.

Perfect for industries ranging from law and logistics to finance and wellness, endpoints eliminate manual intake processes. They serve as the trigger mechanism for responsive automation â€” ensuring every upload, webhook, or submission gets processed immediately and intelligently.`,
